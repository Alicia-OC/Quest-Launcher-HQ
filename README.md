# Requests-Automatization

This is a personal project for educational purposes only.

I have built this web app to learn how to program a full-stack MERN application.

The main goal of this app is to create an email with all the details of a videogame localization project that the freelancer/translator involved would need to start the translation
(e.g deadlines, what kind of game they're going to translate, how many words they need to translate, etc.). Each project manager has their way of sending these requests and each company
uses its own tools or automatization, so after a few years working as a PM I have decided to do my automatization to save me some time and focus on tasks that can't be automatized.

In this app you will be able to create your own requests and request templates by fulfilling a form. The form has personalized inputs and inputs fetched from the database in the backend.
One of the main features and advantages of this app is,  instead of manually writing the list of people you need in the project (which can be easily 10 names),
you'll have a bunch of dropdown menus with options with the names of your translators, and you will only have to click on the option you want instead of writing their names!
